Some background first. The @$pull@ operator in MongoDB is used in conjunction with the @update@ command to remove (or pull out) elements from an array.

The syntax for an @update@ command is
{% highlight javascript %}
db.collection.update(
  { /* find query */ },
  { /* new value */ }
);
{% endhighlight %}
