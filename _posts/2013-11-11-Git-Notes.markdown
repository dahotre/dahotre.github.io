$ git clone http://path-to-the-dot-git-file

$ git checkout -b feature_name

$ git add -u 

//If new files need to be added, then git add <fileName>

$ git commit -m "Commit message"

//Here we are committing to our local repo.. not on a server

$ git checkout master

$ git merge feature_name

$ git pull --rebase

// Possibility of conflicts here..

$ git rebase -i HEAD~10
